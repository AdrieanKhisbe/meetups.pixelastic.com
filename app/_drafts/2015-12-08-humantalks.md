For december, Human Talks was at *LeBonCoin*.
After Several days of conferences with the *dotJs*, *dotCss* and *apiDays* I needed some typing *REST* and I delegated it to [Adrien Becchis](http://twitter.com/adrienbecchis)


## Polyfill and Transpilers, one code for every browser

First talk by Alexandre Barbier (@alexbrbr), explain the why and how of progressive enhancement in js.

One of main task of web developer is to ensure compatibility across browsers. And if things are getting easier (*less painfull*) with the death (*end of lif support*) of severals IE, /web is still the most hostile environment/.

Once target browser has been defined, there is two different ways to do it.

Using **polyfills*, which consist in reimplemnting some API in pure js if this one is not defined. First you need to detect if the feature is available, if not you need to implement it.

If you want to use the last features of js, the one that has not been implemented (such as *EcmaScript 6/2015*), you need to use a **transpiler** (source to source compiler).
More than 270 language target *js*, from *coffescript* to *clojurescript* along with *dart* and *typescript*.
One of the most used is [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) which just hit it's 6th version

## Transhumanism, the singularity advent
After Transpilers, Transhumanism by Pierre Cointe (@pierre_cointe).

The talk present history of transhumanism, that came from Eugenism as a way to evolve willingly the human specy.
*NBIC* Technologies (Nanotech, Biotech, *Informatique*, Communication)

Pierre presented some of the projects associated with it such as immortality, genom manipulation, consciousness transfer.
Then he presented some of Raymond Kurzweil predict, which base on an extended moore law to predict the singularity around 2030, the *singularity* behing the point in time where a super computer would be more powerful than an human brain.

## Develop application for the TV

The next talk was done by MickaÃ«l GREGORI (@meekah3ll)
, and present us his experience developping application for the television.

Not that a friendly place neither, with no standards, SDK, xmls...
After presenting the market he focussed on three product: ChromeCast from Google, Roku, and Android TV.
Most of the application consist in creating a new dynamic channel TC.

To conclude he talk a bit about a standard that my be on it's way, W3C being working on a *TV API*

## How to be more productive with three methods
The fourth and last talk was made by Thibault Vigouroux (teaBough)

He present 3 technics he is using everyday to be more effective at what he is doing.

The first one was the *Podomorro* which consist in working 25 minutes on the task, being focus, then taking a 5 minutes to rest and letting the brain work in difuse mode.
He told us about Podomorro Challenge, an application flexible that rely in gamification to get you used to practice.

Then he present a way to help choose a task, the Eisenhover Matrix. For it you need to label your task according two criteria: importance, emergency.
Basicaly you do now what's both important and urgent, you delegate the urgent non important, and decide when to do what it's important but not urgent. (note how I deleted the section about non important non urgent stuff)

To finish he talk about how to be better at a task with deliberate practice, which he used to switch to *colemak layout*.
5 components are vital for this:

1. Being focused on imporving the result
2. Immediate Feedback
3. Easily repeatable exercices
4. Not really pleasant
5. Mentally Intense

## Conclusion

Very diverse and interesting talks as usual. :)
Good meetup to conclude the year!
