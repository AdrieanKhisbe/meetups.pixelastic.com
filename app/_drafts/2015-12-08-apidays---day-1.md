Christian FaurÃ© and the Oco brading, there is a better way on his laptop
not tehcnical, intends to be philosophical
automation is always robots vs humans, kasparavo against deep blue
so fear, that automatio will kill jobs
all conferences says "software is eating the world"
metaphysical way of thinking, one think against another
but automation is not opposition, it is composition

yound, first, read, write, calculate, learn by heart
if you think too much, you do not get it. it has to become auomatic
then you move forward, but first you need to automate, do things without tinking

culture eats strategy for breakfast
not only design challenge, but organization challenge most of all. the
collective automatism known as culture could kill the strategy

do not oppose creativity with automation
