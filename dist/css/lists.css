/**
 * Layout principles :
 *
 * The base (or optimal) layout is for desktop use. A large content for text,
 * and a fixed sidebar on the right.
 *
 * For larger content, the sidebar will stay on the right side, with its
 * constant width, but the content will be centered in the available space.
 *
 * For smaller content (like tablets), the sidebar will become a header with
 * tabs menus, while for really small content (phones), the header will only
 * contain a menu icon.
